    <!-- TODO: 1 Creating a static chart with svg

      You've seen and played around with the basics coding of inline SVG. 
      Now let's take what you've learned and use it to create a chart, because that is what you are here for :)
      You will create a basic column chart with fixed axis and values. 
      Notice the g element combined with transform/translate is getting a more important role for positioning and aligning other elements.

      Note: Watch wat happens in the browser every step you complete

      <!-- TODO: 1.1 Create the y-axis
        The y-axis is the vertical axis and usually consist of a 
        sequence of (formatted) numbers, percentages, euro's, fte, hours etc.

        - Create a vertical line of 250 (y) units long and place it on the left side of the svg
          - Set the line x1 and x2 to 0
          - Set the line y1 to 0 as well
        - Create five text elements that represent the 'ticks' for the y-axis
          - Create a tick for 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% 
          - Place the ticks on top of the line horizontally (x 0)
          - Spread the 6 ticks evenly (50 units apart) over the line vertically with the correct y position
          - Wrap the line and text elements in a g element and use transform on the g element
            - Translate the g to x 100 and y 50
            - Now some space is made on the left and the top side which you can call a 'margin'
          - To move all text elements to the left of the line, wrap all text elements in another g element and translate it left
          - To align the number of the y-axis and make them more readable/scannable, use text-anchor end (you will probably need to adjust the previous g translate also)

          Note1: stroke!
       -->


      <!-- TODO: 1.2 Create the x-axis
         The x-axis is the horizontal axis and can represent a variety of measures like time, categories, countries, etc.

          - Create the x-axis just like the y-axis
            - Create a horizontal line of 420 (x) units long, The x-axis is usually longer because it needs more room
              - Set the line y1, y2 and x1 to 0
              - Set the y2
            - Create the ticks
              - The x-axis represents 12 months, from january to december (jan to dec) 
              - Position the text at the same y coordinate as the line, namely 0
              - Spread the ticks evenly (35 px units) over the line vertically with the correct x position
            - Wrap the line and text elements in a g element and translate the g element to 
              - x 100 = same as y-axis
              - and y 300 = height of y-axis + margin top you added by transforming the y-axis g
            - Wrap all text elements in another g element and transform it to move the text elements beneath the line
            - Because text elements have a default text-anchor of start, the position of the ticks are a bit weird, especially the last one.
              To center the text at their x position (and also underneath the bars later on) use text-anchor middle.

        Note1: stroke!
        Note2: To make the axis lines connect nicely, use stroke-linecap round

      <!-- TODO: 1.3 Create a bar per month

        Now that you created both axis, it is time to add some rectangles that represent our data.
        Because the bars are drawn vertically in this instance it is actually called a column chart. 
        Bar charts (horizontal) and column charts (vertical) are the most commonly used charts for tracking changes over time between different groups.
        Choosing between bar or column is mostly based on which one is more readable and scannable (see bar chart or column chart link)

        - First of all, our bars also need to account for the margin on the left (and later on top). 
          So create another wrapper g element and translate it to x 100. 
        - Create a rectangle element with 
          - a height of 200 px units (After the first bar, use a number between 0 and 250)
          - a width that corresponds to the px between each x-axis tick (35)
          - a fill color #294899
        - Position the rectangle above the tick
          - For the x coordinate, use the same as the tick
          - For the y coordinate:
            - Take the y position of the x-axis line as your base number
            - Substract the height of the bar from the y position of the x-axis and you will get the correct y for the rect element
        - Repeat the above steps for all the bars

        You will notice that the bars are connecting and form one block.
        This is because we used all the space that we had available between the ticks. 
        To separate the bars, you need to make some space between them (call it a padding).
        - Separate the bars and add some space between them by making the bars 32 px units wide.
        - Remember we set our text elements anchor to middle? The bars are still 'anchored' to start.
          To change this, we want to move all rects half a bar to the left.
          We could do that by change the g element wrapper we already have, 
          but this would make it a bit confusing as the g element we have is used for margin which 100.
          - Add yet another g element that wrappes all rects, inside the one we already have
          - Calculate what half a bar is and translate the new g element to the left to center all bars above the ticks
      
        Almost there! You probably notice the last bar is hanging over our axis line. This is because the last tick and bar
        are centered exactly on the end of the axis line. Also, we placed and centered our first bar at 32 so we have a bit of a gap on the left.
        We can solve this by moving our ticks and bar half a bar to the left.
        - Move the ticks and bars half a bar to the left by editing the inner g element translate values

        - Extra: Ask the instructor how to make the bars animate :)

        Note: The x-axis line actually is a bit longer than the last bar now. this is because of stroke-linecap
       -->
     

      <!-- TODO: Extra Add a line to the chart
        - Add a polyline to the chart and use the same 'data' (y) values as you used for the bars
        - Make sure the line points are centered on the bars

        Note: also use a g element wrapper, or two!
      -->


      <!-- TODO: 1.4 using a margin container element
      The outer g elements are used to create a margin around the chart elements. This margin is used to make room for the axis ticks.
      If the y-axis tick text changed to something longer, say 1.000.000%, you could adjust the left 'margin' to make the y-axis readable.
      Similarly, if the x-axis ticks needed to be higher or multiline, you could adjust the bottom 'margin' to make the x-axis readable.

      But why do we need a margin, can't we just make our chart fit in the svg? 
      Well yes, but it is most common to use ALL the space available to draw the chart, this makes resizing or moving the whole chart a lot easier.
      Another BIG advantage of using margins and a margin container, is that we can always start the drawing
      of lines, the first tick and bar at x or y 0 which makes it easier to understand.

      - Open the svg-margin-container.html with live server. 
        Study the code and read the comments and see if you understand what is going on with the margin container 
        and how it effects the other elements. 
      - Watch the instructor draw some things om the whiteboard ;)

      <!-- TODO: 2 Creating a chart based on a dataset in JavaScript

        We created our first SVG chart manually by hand. Let's create it again, but dynamically in JavaScript.
        Try to use the available width and height of the SVG element, just like in svg-margin-container.html.
        In fact, use svg-margin-container.html as an example of what to build, only you will build it in JavaScript.
        Also, instead of creating fixed sized bars, we will use a dataset.

        - Open the index.js file and study the (read-only) code
          - Notice the pre-calculated value's we will need later on. 
            You should recognize them as manually calculated in svg-margin-container.html
          - Als notice the dataset which represents the same data as our previous chart
        1. Finish the code that creates a single text element that represents an axis tick
        2. 3. 4. and 5. Finish the code that creates the y-axis
        6. 7. 8. and 9. Finish the code that creates the x-axis
        10. 11. 12. 13. 14. Finish the code that creates the columns

        - Extra: Finish the code that creates a line based on the same data as the columns
        - Extra: Use dataset2 instead of dataset. 
          Fix the axis, column and line code so that everything changes if the data changes.
