# SVG our first chart

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of how to use the SVG basic shapes, including circle, rect, line, polyline, polygon and path.
Good understanding of how to use JavaScript to select and manipulate DOM elements.
Basic understanding of the different parts of a chart.

## Essentials

- Repository from Github (Classroom) **svg-dom-manipulation**

## Starting point

Clean HTML file index.html + predefined JavaScript file index.js

## Preparation

Trainer:

- Give everyone access tot the repository via GitHub classroom
- Explain the basic parts of a column chart

Participant:

- Download repository
- Read README.MD
- Study the text from the provided links below if necessary

## Learning objective

Learning to use SVG to create a basic column chart by hand and combine it with JavaScript to make it dynamic and based on a dataset.

## Description

We&#39;ve learned a bit about SVG basic shapes, elements and attributes and how to manipulate them. Now we will use this knowledge to create our very first chart in SVG.

Before we start, it is useful to know a little bit about the parts of the chart we are going to make. You probably already know the most obvious parts like the line, the bar, the y-axis and x-axis, a legend and sometimes a tooltip. Besides the visible parts we will encounter terms like plot, scale, datapoint, series, stack, etc. when diving further into the world of data visualization. See the links for a more complete list of all the parts and terms we will encounter when creating charts.

We will use most of the basic shapes that we saw in previous assignments. Some elements, like the container element (g) will play a more important role when creating charts. We will first manually build the chart with static SVG elements and positioning. After that we will build it again, but dynamically and calculated based on a dataset in JavaScript.

## Result

After the assignment you will have created your first chart in SVG, both statically and dynamically with JavaScript. This will be our first step towards creating charts with D3.js

## Libraries

None, HTML natively supports SVG
